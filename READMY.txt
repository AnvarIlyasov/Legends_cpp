We created a basic C++ project that implements a simple mathematical function — integer addition.

Key Components

1. Math Library (MathLib target)

Static library containing sum(int a, int b) function
Implements integer addition

2. Main Application (MyApp target)

Console program that reads two numbers
Outputs their sum
Includes input validation

3. Test Suite (unit_tests target)

Basic addition
Negative numbers
Zero handling
Uses Catch2 framework

Application Usage:
Enter two numbers: 7 5
12

build:
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
./bin/MyApp
